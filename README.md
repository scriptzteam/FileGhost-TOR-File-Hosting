***Files are encrypted using AES-256-CBC cipher, the private key is never stored on the server. 
We do understand you do NOT trust our encryption/website/Tor so before uploading a file to our website you can always encrypt the file yourself.***  

***UPDATE: All files have extension .encrypted***
***UPDATE: You can now view also encrypted file (link is provided after file is uploaded)***
***UPDATE: We have added to the path VPN so now its working like this: Our server -> VPN -> TOR hidden service -> TOR browser -> You can see the site.***
